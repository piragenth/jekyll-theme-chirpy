## What is Jekyll
Jekyll is a [static site generator](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/static-site-generator/#:~:text=A%20static%20site%20generator%20is,to%20users%20ahead%20of%20time.)(SSC).It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak the siteâ€™s look and feel, URLs, the data displayed on the page, and more.

## Installing docker
#### Updating repo 
```bash
sudo apt update 
```
```bash 
sudo apt install docker.io
```
Installing docker-compose

```bash 
sudo apt install docker-compose
```
## Cloning jekyll theme

Jekyll has an extensive theme system that allows you to leverage community-maintained templates and styles to customize your site's presentation. Jekyll themes specify plugins and package up assets, layouts, includes, and stylesheets in a way that can be overridden by your site's content.

I personally use [jekyll-theme-chripy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chripy) in my website. So i am going use this theme as an example in this tutorial.you can choose whatever theme you like.

### Pick up a theme

* [jamstackthemes.dev](https://jamstackthemes.dev)
* [jekyllthemes.org](https://jekllthemes.org)
* [jekyllthemes.io](https://jekyllthemes.io)
* [jekyll-themes.com](https://jekyll-themes.com)

## Optional: forking theme

I recommend you to fork your favourite theme.
[how to fork github repo](https://blog.devgenius.io/how-to-fork-a-repository-and-push-and-pull-with-github-48b296b2b623)




 So you can host your jekyll website for free in [Github-Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)



```bash
git clone https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chripy

cd  jekyll-theme-chripy #Enter in to the folder
```

This command will clone the repo locally.




## Deploying jekyll in docker

Create docker-compose file 
```bash 
nano docker-compose.yaml
```
this will open a CLI based text editor.
add this file 

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  jekyll-serve:
    container_name: jekyll
    image: jekyll/jekyll:latest
    volumes:
      - "$(PWD):/srv/jekyll"
    ports:
      - 80:4000
    command: 'jekyll serve'
    restart: unless-stopped
```

running docker-compose

```bash 
docker-compose up .
```
If you use custom name for docker-compose file specify that also.
```bash 
docker-compose -f custom-docker-file-name.yaml up 
```

this will bring up the container in port 80.
open the http://localhost 

SUCCESS!!
